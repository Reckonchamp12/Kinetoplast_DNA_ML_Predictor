# Models Directory

This folder is intended to store trained machine learning models in `.pkl` format.

Due to NDA restrictions, the actual model files trained on proprietary GROMACS simulation outputs are **not included** in this repository.

Expected files after training:
- `random_forest.pkl`
- `gradient_boost.pkl`

These models are used for predicting kinetoplast DNA deformation characteristics based on input features extracted from molecular dynamics simulations.
